1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,160
So last week you gained experience with
two steps that are gonna be in common

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:10,160
with pretty much every sequencing analysis
we do in this course. Um, so namely,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,440
um, that is getting sequencing
reads from a source,

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,480
so publicly available databases in
our case, um, and then performing, um,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,270
quality troll on them. Um,

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,110
and so this week we are gonna
build on that knowledge, um,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,550
to see how to use a
polished set of reads, um,

8
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,070
such as the ones we
generated last week, um,

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,350
to answer an actual biological
question this time. Um,

10
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:38,270
and the first thing we're gonna
learn about and do this week, um,

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,500
is all about the process of
mapping, read to a reference genome,

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,820
a process that we will also be doing
repeatedly throughout the course. Um,

13
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:50,700
and this will also entail us
learning about a new file format, um,

14
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,580
that holds this mapping and
alignment information. Then,

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:55,861
uh,

16
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,820
we're gonna explore one of
the many possible downstream
applications of quality,

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,210
the control and mapping that is
variant calling or finding out,

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,570
um, places where your sample
differs from that reference genome.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,290
You did the alignment too. Um, and again,

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,970
this process is called variant calling
and you can use it for a number of very

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,530
interesting, important
applications, um, in particular, uh,

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,160
you will be using it to look at, um,

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,680
some samples of SARS
Cove, two genomes, um,

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,960
from around the Boston
area and beyond, um,

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,880
and check whether or not they have
diagnostic mutations associated with the

26
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:39,080
Delta variant. Um, so very hands on
and very, um, sort of, of the moment,

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,840
highly relevant dataset, um,

28
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:45,630
and to support you towards that
independent analysis of the SARS Cove,

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,350
two genomes and their variants, um,

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,710
there will be several
lectures and tutorials, um,

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,430
and then our weekly assignments, um,

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,150
are some of those knowledge check
quizzes to help you along the way, um,

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,670
a weekly discussion, um,
about variant calling, um,

34
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:05,660
and finally a major assignment and it's
accompanying a peer reviewed writing

35
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:09,620
assignment, um, just like
last week and as always, um,

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,140
my office hours are open as is the
weekly help discussion board. Uh,

37
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,380
good luck this week, everyone.
