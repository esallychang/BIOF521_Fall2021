1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
So

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,480
this week before we dive into any actual
analysis of any real hands on data,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,680
we're going to stop for a second and think
about what you need to think about before

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,960
you even analyze your data or even
send it off to the sequencer.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
So this is all about the planning stage,

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,600
and we're going to be working through
a scenario together right now now,

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,800
which will hopefully happen to you
at some point during your career.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,760
Perhaps you will get exciting news

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,000
from a colleague that a big grant has been
funded and they want to sequence ten

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,960
samples for project you
are working on together.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,560
And with the expertise that you gained
during this class,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,600
you agree to do the post-sequencing
bioinformatic analyses for them.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,900
You are so excited to get started

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,280
with this project, but maybe we
should do some planning first.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:51,120
So take 30 seconds right now to write down
a few topics you'll want to talk with your

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,660
colleague about before
any of the work begins.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,340
I mean, you're gonna submit one
of those to me as a question right now.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,460
Okay.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,800
So we're back from you writing down a few
suggestions, and now take a second

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,440
to compare what you wrote down to some
of the considerations that I thought of,

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,660
which is by no means inclusive
of absolutely everything.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,620
And I'm really excited to see the other
suggestions that you might have.

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,480
So what came to my mind right away? What

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,120
type of sequencing are we going to even
do? How much data are you going to need

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,930
to collect from each individual as far as
the actual material needed for sequencing,

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
how many replicates for your experiment?
Where will these samples actually be

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,570
sequenced at your University or your
collaborators University? Maybe that will

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,260
come down to the cost of doing
it at one of those places.

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,740
So there are a lot of decisions to be
made before any sequencing even begins.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,210
Those are just a few of them.

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,900
So let's say that you've Dove
in and you've made a plan

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,880
and you have an experimental design
for maybe an RNA see experiment,

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,680
and you've chosen how you're going
to sequence and where you're going

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,930
to sequence your data and that you're
going to do the analysis, of course.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,280
So now we're going to pause again and have
you take 30 seconds and again submit one

36
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,760
of these suggestions to me
and think of the types of data that you're

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,730
going to need for your analysis
that you're calling.

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,340
I need to record about these samples

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,020
before they are even
sent to the sequencer.

40
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:26,120
So what should they be keeping in mind if
they're the person who's actually getting

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,600
the material from the mice or
whatever you're experimenting upon?

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,540
Okay.

43
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,360
And again, let's compare.

44
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,760
You might have written down to some

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,960
examples that again,
I've had experience with in the past or

46
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,720
just now came to my mind again,
not totally inclusive.

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,640
And again, very excited to see if
you thought of something I didn't.

48
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,820
Of course, you're going to want to note,

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,640
however, you're keeping track of your
sample IDs for each of your samples,

50
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,400
whether they're individual tissue samples
or samples taken from different genotypes

51
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,280
of mice, whatever is relevant
for your study, basically.

52
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,960
So that would just be any characteristics

53
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,200
of the input material itself from DNA
concentration, the sequencing barcode.

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,520
You're giving it things that we'll be
talking about later in the course.

55
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,580
And then, as I mentioned, details
about the sample itself, of course.

56
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,660
So if it's relevant to you to know,

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,480
for example,
if the samples come from a male or female,

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,780
you're going to want
to collect that information.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
If it's really important to know exactly

60
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,340
what tissue it came from for your
experiment, you will also record that.

61
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,220
So these details about the sample itself

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,160
are really dependent on exactly what
your variables of interest are.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,360
But I would always recommend jotting down
probably more than you think,

64
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,400
especially if it's data you're not
going to be able to recreate later.

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,460
And we're going to talk about sort of

66
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,400
minimal reporting of different types
of this data for different types

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,460
of projects in the upcoming weeks as we
go through different types of fencing.

68
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,740
And so all of this type of data that's not
the actual sequencing data itself

69
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,380
or the experimental actual data
points is called metadata,

70
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,380
or, as we call it,
basically data about the data.

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,420
So here is data, the cat,

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,620
and perhaps some metadata that we
could collect about data.

73
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,000
The cat are things like, where was
this photo of this adorable cat taken?

74
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,000
And on what date?
Maybe that's going to help help us seek

75
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,720
out where this adorable cat is
living and pet it for ourselves.

76
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,500
And PS data would be
an excellent name for a cat.

77
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,900
So it's the data about the data,
and metadata is super important

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,900
for reasons that we will discover
together through this course.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,400
I mean, ultimately, data is not
meaningful without metadata.

80
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,160
If you just have random sequencing

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,100
but didn't record which experimental
treatment it came from,

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,300
how you prepared the DNA for sequencing,
et cetera, et cetera.

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,200
You're not going to be able to sort
of link it back to the question

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,400
that you're trying to answer
by doing the sequencing.

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,720
So metadata
we can think of is the link between your

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,980
data and your original biological question
or the biological system at hand.

87
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,100
And in fact, organizations

88
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,600
have or in the process of establishing
standards for the type of metadata

89
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,300
that need to be included
with different types of sequencing.

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,160
So we'll talk about later in this course.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,280
But when you submit your data as you
should to a public database,

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,740
when you're done with your project,
you really need to be careful about what

93
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,060
type of info they expect you
to submit with that data.

94
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,100
Okay.

95
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,880
So the moment has happened,
you are about to get your data back.

96
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,860
All that metadata has been collected,

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,800
but now there are a few
other things to consider.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,980
So you know, you're about to get your
sequencing data in a couple of weeks.

99
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,740
It's in the sequencing queue.

100
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,280
Again, let's take a few seconds and think

101
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,480
of what things come to mind as
you prepare to receive the data.

102
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,620
That's going to save you big headaches
later as you are doing the analysis.

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
So

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm just going to suggest a few whole
categories of things that I would

105
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:20,220
personally already be thinking about when
I know my data is on the way to coming

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,480
to me and for me to work on and again,
compare this to what you got.

107
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm sure that some of these things are
things that you definitely thought of,

108
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,660
and perhaps some of them will be
new to you to be kind of exciting.

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
So

110
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,600
one big question is, where is
this data going to to get stored?

111
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,680
You'll see working through this course

112
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,340
that the sequencing files and all
of the intermediate files you generate

113
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,320
while working through a bioinformatics
pipeline are huge and quite plentiful.

114
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,700
So please note that all of the sizes

115
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,860
in this table are, in fact,
in gigabytes so they can fill up even big

116
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,520
terabyte size hard drives
in absolutely no time.

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,580
So might be by some
of those ahead of time.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,460
Make sure your University's serve has
room for you, et cetera, et cetera.

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,560
On a similar note, where are
we going to analyze this data?

120
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,820
Many applications that are for processing

121
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:21,780
big data sets of sequencing data require
significant memory and or require parallel

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,360
processing processing,
meaning we need multiple processors

123
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,840
working in parallel to get the job done
in any sort of reasonable amount of time.

124
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,360
As we'll talk about,
this is something that's particularly

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,580
of a concern when doing things like
assembling whole Genome Gnomes.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,040
So for the most part, we can't
run these directly on the laptop.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
So you might want to start looking at,

128
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,700
for example, does your institution have
a computer cluster here at the NIH?

129
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,760
A huge part of my job is communicating

130
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,420
with a big super computer
that we call Bio Wolf.

131
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,400
During this course,

132
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,460
we're going to work on a public
server called the Galaxy Project.

133
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
You're going to be super
familiar with that.

134
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,520
And then there are things like

135
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,760
Amazon Web Services, which I'm sure
you've heard of that you can set up to.

136
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,940
Also do buyer Informatics on if your local

137
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,320
computing is not sufficient, but again,
totally planning this ahead of time.

138
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,140
Additionally, it's not enough to just be
like, okay, I'm going to use the server.

139
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,240
You also need to make sure of things like
is the software that I will need to get

140
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,540
my expected outputs from this data
even available on my University's server?

141
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,980
Do I need them to

142
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,000
install a bunch of things for me
been through that where software expected

143
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,900
was not actually there or not installed
properly or the most updated version.

144
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,220
You can also, for example,
decide what software to use by reading

145
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,920
studies that use similar data
to answer similar questions.

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
This is a huge part of preparing to do

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,100
an analysis, and we're going to read some
of those examples during this course

148
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,660
and also just starting to think about can
the software be chained together

149
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,960
in a pipeline
like this one that takes a certain input

150
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,700
data does a bunch of steps without you
needing to do any manual

151
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,180
input in the middle and then
produces an expected output.

152
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,460
And again, that's something
we will practice together.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
So

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,720
one thing that's going to be key
to planning and analysis,

155
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,140
and that much detail is finding relevant
sequencing data that you can perhaps

156
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,480
practice on, or at least it'll provide
a backbone of building your own pipeline.

157
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,320
And perhaps I'll actually be good

158
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,340
to compare your results
to their findings to see if what you're

159
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,260
getting is reasonable
and sort of build upon that.

160
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,200
And luckily, it's pretty easy
to find relevant sequencing data.

161
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,260
So here is a paper
by some of my colleagues.

162
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,400
It is a very cool paper about single cell

163
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,420
sequencing in an invertebrate called
Hydra, and it's super cool study.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,640
And so perhaps I want to compare it
to a project that I'm working on right now

165
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,460
that's working on single cell sequencing
and a relative of this organism.

166
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,620
So very cool.

167
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,100
But where can I find the raw data to
compare to my own organism of interest?

168
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,620
Luckily, most papers have what's called
a data statement in the side of them,

169
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,280
as required by different federal
and otherwise granting agencies.

170
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,920
Many things actually require this.

171
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,020
Many publications actually
require this as well.

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,560
And so you can scroll down to this.

173
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,960
This is often near the

174
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,920
acknowledgement section and find some
little, very helpful numbers here.

175
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,740
And we're going to focus on this bio
project number I put in a box right here.

176
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,100
So we're going to do this in practice
in one of the next tutorials.

177
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,420
But just as an example, you can search

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,180
this number on the NCBI website,
and it'll take you to this whole page

179
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,080
about this project,
and we can retrieve in absolutely tons

180
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,920
of information and the structure of one
of these bio projects as we'll go

181
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,800
into more depth about essentially,
it looks like this.

182
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,340
So we have our overarching project that
has an ID number that looks like this.

183
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,900
It contains information about individual

184
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,620
samples that are within this study.

185
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,060
So perhaps these are two different
whole samples of that Hydro organism.

186
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,260
And then perhaps those biosamples,

187
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,340
one of them was used to generate
some short sequencing reads.

188
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,820
And perhaps those are the ones we're

189
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,460
interested in for our single
cell sequencing analysis.

190
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:44,420
And perhaps another sample was used
to generate a genome sequence that we can

191
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,600
use in conjunction with the short read
data of whatever type that it is.

192
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,240
Of course, project structures can be a bit
more complicated, because if you probably

193
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,500
imagine,
you can have sub projects where maybe

194
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,580
you're very focused on the transcriptome
of certain samples for a while.

195
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,640
And also, of course,

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,780
you might imagine that individual
samples are the same genotype.

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
You probably want to get a transcriptome

198
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,600
in a genome from the same organism to make
down Stanly is as easy as possible.

199
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,300
So in reality,

200
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,000
more than an organized hierarchy,
sometimes it looks kind of like a web,

201
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,460
but we're going to practice navigating
this web together in this week and pretty

202
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,640
much in every future week as a way
of getting publicly available data

203
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,100
that we're going to use
throughout this course.

204
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,000
What you'll find if you click through

205
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,660
enough links as we will do that we're
in the NCBI short Read Archive, or SRA,

206
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,460
and what this is the raw data
associated sequencing projects.

207
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,460
So, for example, for this one,

208
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,540
it'll get you to a list of a bunch
of different luminous sequence sing runs

209
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,160
of different tissue types from that same
Hydra sequencing project.

210
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,580
And again, we're going to get plenty
of practice finding and downloading data

211
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,300
from the SRA during this course as early
as pretty much the first tutorial here.

212
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,440
So to summarize,

213
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,800
there is plenty to consider before
the analysis, even beacons so, of course,

214
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,220
experimental design and other
pre sequencing concerns.

215
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,300
What metadata are we gonna to make sure
to get before it goes to the sequencer?

216
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,960
Where to store the data,
where to analyze the data?

217
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,120
What software do we need? And of course,

218
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,580
is there similar data out there
to practice on and compare our results to

219
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,760
thanks so much for listening and good
luck with this week's projects.
