## Counting

The alignment produces a set of BAM files, where each file contains the read alignments for each sample. In the BAM file, there is a chromosomal location for every read that mapped. Now that we have figured out where each read comes from in the genome, we need to summarise the information across genes or exons. The mapped reads can be counted across mouse genes by using a tool called **featureCounts**. featureCounts requires gene annotation specifying the genomic start and end position of each exon of each gene. For convenience, featureCounts contains built-in annotation for mouse (`mm10`, `mm9`) and human (`hg38`, `hg19`) genome assemblies, where exon intervals are defined from the NCBI RefSeq annotation of the reference genome. 

Reads that map to exons of genes are added together to obtain the count for each gene, with some care taken with reads that span exon-exon boundaries. The output is a count for each Entrez Gene ID, which are numbers such as `100008567`. For other species, users will need to read in a data frame in GTF format to define the genes and exons. Users can also specify a custom annotation file in SAF format. See the tool help in Galaxy, which has an example of what an SAF file should like like, or the Rsubread users guide for more information.



> ## Hands-on: Count reads mapped to genes with **featureCounts**
> 1. Run <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-tool" style="pointer-events: none"> **featureCounts** </button> modifying the following parameters: 
> + *"Alignment file"*: `aligned reads (BAM)` (output of **HISAT2**). 
> + *"Gene annotation file"*: `featureCounts built-in`. 
> 	- *"Select built-in genome"*: `mm10`. 
> 
> 2. Applying the same logic as the last time we ran MultiQC, run <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-tool" style="pointer-events: none"> MultiQC </button> with the appropriate options for the output of **featureCounts**. 
> 3. Add a tag `#featurecounts` to the Webpage output from MultiQC and inspect the webpage.

> ## Note: **featureCounts** parameters
> In this example we have kept many of the default settings, which are typically optimised to work well under a variety of situations. **For example, the default setting for featureCounts is that it only keeps reads that uniquely map to the reference genome. For testing differential expression of genes, this is preferred, as the reads are unambigously assigned to one place in the genome** allowing for easier interpretation of the results. Understanding all the different parameters you can change involves doing a lot of reading about the tool that you are using, and can take a lot of time to understand! We wonâ€™t be going into the details of the parameters you can change here, but you can get more information from looking at the tool help.

The counts for the samples are output as tabular files. Take a look at one. The numbers in the first column of the counts file represent the Entrez gene identifiers for each gene, while the second column contains the counts for each gene for the sample.

> ## Hands-On: Finding out more about a gene
> 1. Let's look at the first gene in the mapping output for `SRR1552452`. For me (it may vary), it is an ID number of `497097`, and there are `65` reads which have mapped to it. 
> 2. Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.
> 3. In the search bar, enter `497097` and choose `Gene` in the dropdown menu next to the search bar. 
> 4. This number can be found in multiple databases, so click on the `Gene` results. 
> 5. We can see that this gene is `Xkr4`, or `X-linked Kx blood group related 4`. 
> 6. This page also serves as a portal for A LOT of other information about the gene, which may come in handy later:
